            Hi there, my name is <strong>Praise Babalola</strong> and I am pursuing a 
            Bachelor of Applied Computer Science at Dalhousie University. Throughout my 
            academic journey, I have always sought to solve intricate problems, which 
            eventually led me down the computer science path. As these are still the early 
            days of my career, I am eager to connect with others, collaborate on innovative 
            projects, and contribute meaningfully to a company's mission.
          </p>
